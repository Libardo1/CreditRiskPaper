**Codes for replication and implementation of techniques in our credit risk article**. 

In this repo, we provide codes used in the ["Credit Risk Analysis Using Machine and Deep Learning Models"](http://www.mdpi.com/2227-9091/6/2/38). Given that we can not provide access to the dataset, we have generated data with 10 observations keeping the same structure as original data. We made use of [H2o](https://www.h2o.ai), which is an open-source machine learning platform for enterprises.  


* `CreditRisk_Main.Rmd` contains all you need to replicate or adapted the code for your usecase :) 

* `creditdata.csv` is the main dataset. 

* `data4drive` folder containing train, validation and test dataset. Please note that the data files are empty since we are not allow to share such information. 

Special credit to the [H2o.ai](https://www.h2o.ai) team for making the machine learning platform open-sourced.  

Have fun playing with the code with your data. 

Cheers! :)
